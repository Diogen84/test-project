# test-project
Written by Vitalii Vystavnyi

This is a single-page demo website in mockup style.
I spent about 2-3 hours to develop it.
To start the project you should clone it to your apache server due to cross-origin requests(getting json from server).
In this project I used html, css3, pure javascript and angular.js framework for logic.
